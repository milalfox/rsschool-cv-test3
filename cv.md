## Work experience
At first I was a teacher of chemistry and biology (2010-2014). Then she worked as a laboratory assistant in chemical analysis (2015-2016). I am currently a chemistry tutor (from 2016 to the present). There is no work experience in the IT industry yet, but I plan to get it in the future.
